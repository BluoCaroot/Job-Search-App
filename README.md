# Job Search App

during my node.js backend development diploma at route academy I was tasked with creating the apis for a job search app

## database models

the database consists of:

a user model containing the data of the app users
a company model for the companies that post jobs
a job model containing the descriptions of the jobs
an application model that contains the resume and skills of users applying to the job


## more information

resumes uploaded are hosted on cloudinary free host service
the postman apis are available in the repo's root in case you would like to test them yourself

feel free to edit this repositry and reuse it however you like (a fork would be appreciated ^ ^)
